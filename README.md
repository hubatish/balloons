Very quick project with popping balloons (that respond to touch on Android).

For supersonic, try running and playing the supersonic.apk on Android to get errors.  Also, google play services has not been added yet, and the Android Manifest may still be incorrect.  

To "play" this awful game open Menu, click on play button.
Then you're in the Main room with balloons that can pop by clicking.
